  <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>
  <p>
    In this course we'll go over the fundamentals of the React (or ReactJs) library.  It is expected that anyone taking this course already
    has a grasp on Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.  As part of this course we'll also cover the fundamentals of JSX and how it is utilized
    in React.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout this course you may use the menu navigation on the top left to browse between section.  After the content is created I intend
    to create some sort of bookmark that you'll be able to use to resume from where you left off.
