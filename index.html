  <h1>TIME TO REACT!</h1>
  <p>
    In this course we'll go over the fundamentals of the React (or ReactJs) library.  It is expected that anyone taking this course already
    has a grasp on Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.  As part of this course we'll also cover the fundamentals of JSX and how it is utilized
    in React.

    For now I ask that you use a bookmark or note to save where you leave off.  After the content is created I intend
    to create a "resume" feature for a better experience.  When you're ready click the button below to begin.
