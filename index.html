  <p>
    In this course we'll go over the fundamentals of the React (or ReactJs) library.  It is expected that anyone taking this course already
    has a grasp on Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.  As part of this course we'll also cover the fundamentals of JSX and how it is utilized
    in React.

    Throughout this course you may use the menu navigation on the top left to browse between sections.  Within each
    section or unit a basic outline will be provided.  The outline links will allow you to easily navigate to the different
    topics within a section.  Please become acustom to the layout using our example below.
