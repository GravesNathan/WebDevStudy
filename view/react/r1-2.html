  <h2>Why use React?</h2>
  <p>
    Before we get too deep let's talk about why this library has become popular.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Faster Loading: <br />The normal DOM can be hard to work with.  Most JS frameworks (or libraries) work with the DOM.  The problem
      with using the DOM is that one small change (such as adding an item to a list) require the whole DOM to be re-loaded with the desired change.
      <br /><br />The Virtual DOM loads much faster than the real DOM and what React specializes in is the method in which
      it utilized the virtual DOM.  Simply put, when a change is requested the entire virutal DOM is updated, the virutal DOM is then compared to
      what it looked like before the change, and (the best part) ONLY the CHANGED objects are applied to the real DOM!  This can dramatically reduce
      the loading time of websites!  See this page to learn more

    <li>
      Dynamic Webpages/Faster Development: <br />React uses a Components based structure (more on Components later).  For now what you should know is Components
      are small pieces of code that are easy to update and maintain.  These components are extremely modular, greatly reducing the amount of time produce duplicate
      code across websites.
