  <h2>What is JSX</h2>
    <p>
      According to <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101' title='Code Academy React Tutorial'>CodeAcademy</a>
      <br /><br />"JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React.
      JSX code looks a lot like HTML making it convenient for use with React.<br /><br />
      The fact that it's a syntax extension means that JSX is not valid JavaScript.
      Web browsers can't read it! If a JavaScript file contains JSX code,
      then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the
      file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript."
    </p>
    <p>
      The extension is so widely used that we're actually going to focus this entire secton on JSX alone!
      We'll also be using it throughout the remainder of this course so be sure you understand section 2
      thoroughly before moving on to section 3.
