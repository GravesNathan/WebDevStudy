  <h1>Section 1: React Introduction</h1>
  <h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>
  <p>
    Now get get to start the real fun!  There are a few methods to setting up a local environment to learn React.  What's important to understand
    is that React is a server side framework.  It's also important to know that, as with other frameworks, React is actually not understood by any browsers.
    <br /><br />To successfully implement React you're going to need to have a local install which will act as your server.  One way of doing this
    is to find, download, and install, each of the required frameworks used by React.  Depending on the version installed the plugins required can vary as well.
    <br /><br />
    To simplify our course we'll be installing React by utilizing a handy pre-built package as detailed below.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Download and Install <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/' title='NodeJS'>NodeJS</a></strong><br />
        The package for our next step requires npm.  Since NodeJs includes npm I've included this as our first step.  If you already have npm working in your environment you can skip step 1.
        <br /><br />The version I'll be using for this tutorial is 10.15.3 LTS.  It is generally recommend you stick with the current recommended version,
        but if you have trouble and need an old version you can check <a href='/WebDevTutorial/view/react/r5-0.html' title='Download here'>here</a>.<br />
